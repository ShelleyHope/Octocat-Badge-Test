Git clone makes a copy of another "git-repo" and creates a directory folder of the same name: git-repo [in the directory from where the command was issued]. The newly created git-repo file is initialised by the addition of a .git file. All files and any branching history of the original cloned repo are also copied to the new cloned repo.

N.B. changes can only be 'pushed' back from the clone to the original repo by approved collaborators.
